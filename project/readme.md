# Final Project: Swing Decision Hierarchical Modeling

Files for the final project are here. Main underlying code is in swing_decision_model.py, and the model is implemented and evaluated in swing_decisions.ipynb. The Swing Decision By Count Effects notebook is experimental code from PyMC (that admittedly was hard to figure out and didn't turn out great)
